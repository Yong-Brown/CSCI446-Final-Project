This project succeeded in achieving all that we had in the proposal.

1. Were there areas of unexpected complexity? If so, how did you handle them or how did you decide to cut scope?

    No, most of the project was replicated seemlessly from examples in class

2. What was the most interesting part of the final project?

    The front end compiles as expected and the layout of the webpage conforms to expectation.

3. If you had more time, what do you wish you could have added to the final project?

    Make a more complicated API, incorporating other websites to include images.
